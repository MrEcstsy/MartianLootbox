# MartianLootbox

MartianLootbox is a PocketMine plugin that allows server admins to create and manage lootboxes with a customizable, interactive experience. Lootboxes are containers that players can interact with to receive random rewards, all packaged with smooth animations and a user-friendly interface.

## Overview

MartianLootbox introduces a unique and customizable lootbox system to your server. The plugin supports both animated and non-animated reward claim experiences, providing an engaging way for players to earn rewards. Administrators can easily configure lootboxes, and players can interact with them through in-game actions.

### Key Features:
- **Shuffle Animation**: A smooth animation for showing lootbox rewards (can be toggled on/off).
- **No Animation Option**: A basic “click and claim” system for those who prefer simplicity.
- **Customizable Reward Previews**: View rewards before claiming them.

## Commands

### `/ml`
Lists all available commands. Admins can use this to view all the subcommands available.

## Preview

### 1. Shuffle Animation (Animation Enabled)
Experience the smooth shuffle animation that visually shows the lootbox rewards being randomized before the player claims them.

### 2. No Animation (Click and Claim)
For a simpler approach, the "No Animation" mode displays a direct reward claim option without any animations. This mode is perfect for a quicker, more straightforward experience.
